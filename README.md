This repository will contain sample code and utilities to build analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Purview. https://github.com/microsoft/HRDIUtilities
These are some of the utilities and tools built by our team HR Data and Insights in Microsoft Digital.
We want to share them as open source to public. These are likely to come in handy for anyone attempting to onboard and build analytical solutions in Fabric and Purview. These utilities will act as accelerators for usage of Fabric and Purview.
Below are two utilities we plan to release via this repo
Metadata driven data ingestion utility : This utility designed for data ingestion in Delta Lakes using Microsoft Fabric, addressing challenges in ingestion such as manual intervention and inconsistent data quality.
Microsoft Purview SaaS migration utility:  This utility is to help simplify onboarding to Microsoft Purview (Saas) version. It addresses some of the challenges in the migration lifecycle.
All the utilities in this repository will be small utilities within 5k lines of code, do not contain any real-world data, do not collect any telemetry and do not include any cryptography.
